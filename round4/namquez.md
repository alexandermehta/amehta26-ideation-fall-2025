## 1. What I Explored Today

_List the projects you seriously considered. Keep it brief._

| Project Name | Source | Key Takeaway (1 sentence) |
|--------------|--------|---------------------------|
| Where2Go  | Round 3 | Very feasible scope on campus, clear value + crowdsourcing fits naturally. |
| Culinary Archive  | Round 3 | Clear before/after value; modular tasks; low qualifications needed for crowd workers; durable public good. |
| Game Genre Classifier From Game Clips  | Round 1 | Tagging gameplay clips is extremely fast, fun, and low cognitive load for gamers, so participation is natural and self-sustaining.  |


**Resources I used**:
- [x] Rubric scoring
- [x] V2 detailed analyses
- [x] Steelman Analysis pathways
- [x] Group discussions
- [ ] Other: [specify]

## 2. My Decision

**Project Name**: [Your final choice]

**Decision type**:
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (same approach)
- [ ] STAYING with Round 3 project (modified approach/scope)
- [x] PIVOTING to different project
- [ ] JOINING another team's project

**If pivoting or adopting someone's idea**:
- Original author (if applicable): [vavali]
- Original round: [R2]

## 3. Why This Decision

**High-level reasoning** (2-3 paragraphs):

Where2Go solves a very real problem that literally every student experiences but nobody currently has a clean solution for. It is inherently crowdsourcing-native because ground truth / freshness actually gets better as more people use it. It also has extremely low barrier tasks (rate a bathroom, check if something still has toilet paper) which fits the class requirements for short and simple worker contributions. Out of all the concepts I looked at, this is the most testable fast and the least architecture-heavy to get into MVP.

**What convinced me**:
- clear pain point + extremely common use case
- can validate on Penn campus extremely fast
- core contributions require almost no instruction

**What concerns me** (and how I'll address it):
- People trolling / joke submissions. Having weighted reputation + flagging + CV detection
- Hard to bootstrap enough entries. Early “review bounties” + leaderboard incentives for under-covered areas

## 4. What I'm Building

**One-sentence project description**:
[Describe your project in one clear sentence]

**MVP Scope** (3-4 core features only):

**MVP Scope (3-4)**:
1. **Bathroom submission**: Users can add a bathroom + location + rate 4 categories.
2. **Bathroom verification**: Users can confirm or flag existing locations.
3. **Interactive campus map**: See bathrooms around you color-coded by aggregated score.
4. **Simple contributor reputation**: Verified actions slightly weight ratings.

**Explicitly NOT building**:
- City-wide / Philadelphia scale this semester
- Computer vision moderation system beyond simple filters
- Full social system (comments threads, DM, content feed)
---

## 5. Week 1 Validation

**The specific test I'll run Week 1**:
- **Where**: post in r/UPenn subreddit + CIS160 Slack
- **When**: Any day of the week 
- **What**: ask students to submit 1 bathroom rating + whether they would use this regularly  
- **Success metric**: 10+ bathroom submissions + 20+ poll responses / reactions in 48 hours

**If Week 1 test fails, I will**:
- [ ] Pivot to: Lost+Found CV-lite version
- [x] Try different recruitment channel: ask 2 big student clubs (HypeBeast PENN / DSP) to post it
- [ ] Simplify task to: only bathroom up/down with no categories
- [ ] Othe

## 6. **Tentative** Team (Optional, Only If You Already Have An Idea)

At this stage, you are not expected to have formed teams, however if you already have an idea of who you intend to work with, you may indicate it here.

**Team members**:

1. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
2. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role]
3. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_
4. [Name] ([PennKey]) - [Primary role] _(optional)_

**Team status**:
- [ ] Same team from Round 3
- [ ] New team formed during Round 4
- [ ] Solo (will find teammates later)
- [ ] Joining an existing team

## 7. Reflection

**Most valuable part of Round 4**:  
The structured steelman analysis forced me to aggressively check feasibility / testability rather than “cool factor.”

**Biggest surprise**:  
Bathroom data is surprisingly high value and extremely social coordination friendly, much more than expected.

**One thing I'd tell future students about Round 4**:  
It’s not about the coolest idea, it’s about what idea will actually reach validation fast.

## Commitment

**I commit to**:
- [x] Building the MVP scope above (3-4 features maximum)
- [x] Running a concrete Week 1 validation test
- [x] Pivoting if Week 1 shows <20% success
- [x] Meeting with instructor if I hit major blockers
