# Crowdsourcing Project Idea: [Project Title]

## Author
[Martina Bulgarelli]

## Problem Statement
[College students frequently report that dining hall meals are repetitive, unhealthy, or unappetizing. Many end up relying on takeout or processed snacks instead of making healthier choices. There is currently no system where students can collectively transform dining hall ingredients into quick, nutritious, low-cost meals tailored to dorm life.]

## Core Concept
**One-line pitch:** [A crowdsourced library of healthy dining-hall “remix” meals students can make using only what’s available on campus.]

**Target users:** [College students living in dorms who eat in dining halls and want healthier, tastier, affordable meals.]

**The crowd:** [Campus volunteers and peers (Penn students), incentivized by social recognition and small rewards.]

**The task:** [Take ingredients from the dining hall → create a simple meal or “remix” (max 5 mins, microwave/fridge only) → upload: Photo of ingredients + final dish; Quick recipe steps; Estimated cost (swipe/dining dollars); Nutrition and allergy tags; Workers then vote on taste, healthiness, and effort.]

## Key Features
1. [Smart tagging (allergens, vegan, high protein, <$3 per serving, etc.)]
2. [Gamified leaderboards for most upvoted remixes]  
3. [Nutrition badges (“Brain Booster,” “Post-Workout,” “Low Sugar”) auto-assigned via ingredients]

## Feasibility Check
**Data source:** [User-submitted photos + recipes from dining halls on campus.]

**Budget reality:** [Only hypothetical idea: $250 in Amazon/food gift cards as incentives, $200 for hosting and promotion materials No specialized hardware needed → <$500 total]

**Crowd size needed:** [150–300 student contributors (each with multiple submissions)]

**Quality control approach:** [Photo proof required (ingredients + final result) Minimum 3-reviewer consensus on nutrition tags Upvotes determine top selections; moderator reviews duplicates]

## Technical Approach
**Human tasks:** [Create and document dining hall remixes Evaluate others’ recipes based on taste, healthiness, and accessibility Flag inaccurate nutrition/allergy tags]

**Automated tasks:** [Nutrition estimation using ingredient databases Duplicate detection via text and ingredient similarity Score calculation for rankings]

**Aggregation method:** [Weighted scoring: Final Score = (50% Taste Votes) + (30% Health Badge Score) + (20% Cost Efficiency) Top recipes highlighted as “Dorm Chef Approved.”]

## Prior Work
**Similar projects:** [Tasty & social cooking apps (recipes, but not campus-specific or crowdsourced) How ours differs: Unique constraint: dorm-safe appliances + only dining hall ingredients = high relevance & structure]

**Lessons from past course projects:** [Cold start problem can be reduced by seeding 20 initial recipes Clear rubrics → lower subjectivity & cleaner labeling]

## Why This Could Work
[Students have a strong interest in enhancing their day-to-day dining experience, and the required contributions are quick, enjoyable, and creative, which should drive strong participation. The resulting dataset will be well-structured, highly relevant to campus life, and manageable within the project’s scope and budget. The system has the potential to meaningfully support healthier habits while establishing a lasting, student-powered resource.]
