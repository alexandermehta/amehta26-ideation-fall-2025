Crowdsourcing Project Idea: [Project Title]
Author
[Martina Bulgarelli, mbulga]

Problem Statement
[In 2-3 sentences, describe the real-world problem your project will solve.]
College students frequently report that dining hall meals are repetitive, unhealthy, or unappetizing. 
Many end up relying on takeout or processed snacks instead of making healthier choices. 
There is currently no system where students can collectively transform dining hall ingredients into quick, nutritious, low-cost meals tailored to dorm life.

Core Concept
One-line pitch: [What does your project do in one sentence?]
A crowdsourced library of healthy dining-hall “remix” meals students can make using only what’s available on campus.

Target users: [Who will benefit from this system?]
College students living in dorms who eat in dining halls and want healthier, tastier, affordable meals.

The crowd: [Who are your workers? MTurk, volunteers, social media users?]
Campus volunteers and peers (Penn students), incentivized by social recognition and small rewards.

The task: [What EXACTLY will crowd workers do? Be specific.]
Take ingredients from the dining hall → create a simple meal or “remix” (max 5 mins, microwave/fridge only) → upload:
Photo of ingredients + final dish;
Quick recipe steps;
Estimated cost (swipe/dining dollars);
Nutrition and allergy tags;
Workers then vote on taste, healthiness, and effort.

Key Features
[Smart tagging] (allergens, vegan, high protein, <$3 per serving, etc.)
[Gamified leaderboards] for most upvoted remixes
[Nutrition badges] (“Brain Booster,” “Post-Workout,” “Low Sugar”) auto-assigned via ingredients

Feasibility Check
Data source: [Where will input data come from?]
User-submitted photos + recipes from dining halls on campus.

Budget reality: [How can this work with < $500?]
Only hypothetical idea: $250 in Amazon/food gift cards as incentives, $200 for hosting and promotion materials
No specialized hardware needed → <$500 total

Crowd size needed: [Rough estimate: 10s, 100s, 1000s of workers?]
150–300 student contributors (each with multiple submissions)

Quality control approach: [Initial idea for ensuring quality]
Photo proof required (ingredients + final result)
Minimum 3-reviewer consensus on nutrition tags
Upvotes determine top selections; moderator reviews duplicates

Technical Approach
Human tasks: [What parts require human intelligence?]
Create and document dining hall remixes
Evaluate others’ recipes based on taste, healthiness, and accessibility
Flag inaccurate nutrition/allergy tags

Automated tasks: [What parts will be computational?]
Nutrition estimation using ingredient databases
Duplicate detection via text and ingredient similarity
Score calculation for rankings

Aggregation method: [How will you combine crowd responses?]
Weighted scoring: Final Score = (50% Taste Votes) + (30% Health Badge Score) + (20% Cost Efficiency)
Top recipes highlighted as “Dorm Chef Approved.”

Prior Work
Similar projects: [Name 1-2 related projects and how yours differs]
Tasty & social cooking apps (recipes, but not campus-specific or crowdsourced)
How ours differs: Unique constraint: dorm-safe appliances + only dining hall ingredients = high relevance & structure

Lessons from past course projects: [What did you learn from reviewing past projects?]
Cold start problem can be reduced by seeding 20 initial recipes
Clear rubrics → lower subjectivity & cleaner labeling

Why This Could Work
[2-3 sentences on why this is viable within course constraints]
Students have a strong interest in enhancing their day-to-day dining experience, and the required contributions are quick, enjoyable, and creative, which should drive strong participation. 
The resulting dataset will be well-structured, highly relevant to campus life, and manageable within the project’s scope and budget. 
The system has the potential to meaningfully support healthier habits while establishing a lasting, student-powered resource.
